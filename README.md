# Dartmouth_median_interactive
An interactive D3 plot highlighting the median GPA and enrollments across departments. Incorporates hover features, drop box, radio toggle features, and separates Department based on internal classifications. 


In approaching this developer challenge, my focus was on integrating extensive functionality to meet the requirements. I've been particularly engaged with the interactive elements, aligning with the challenge's objective of comprehensive data visualization. Rather than limiting features, I opted for a multifunctional approach to provide users with a seamless exploration experience. The primary aim was to substantially elevate the visual representation compared to previous iterations.

Instead of relying on conventional dot plots or scatter plots, I pursued a distinctive visualization strategy, emphasizing an enhanced color scheme. To enhance chart clarity, I employed an averaging strategy across all departments, analyzing patterns in the relationship between class enrollment and GPA. This analysis revealed a discernible trend of decreasing GPA with increasing enrollment numbers.

Furthermore, I implemented features to highlight both top and bottom departments, offering insights into their respective GPAs. Hover functionality was incorporated to provide additional information about departments, categorized into STEM, Languages, Interdisciplinary, Social Sciences, and Humanities.

I identified a correlation indicating lower GPAs in STEM courses compared to higher GPAs in Language courses. This correlation was accentuated through the color layout. While the hover functionality was seamlessly integrated, challenges arose in effectively highlighting points mapped to colors on the legend and accurately organizing them.

Additionally, I aimed to assess the quality of courses based on data from the layup list. This involved imagining circles around squares representing departmental quality. While challenging to implement, this project served as a valuable learning experience, emphasizing the potential for continual augmentation of functionality.
